## Conclusion and Future Directions

Linguistic analysis of the bioRxiv repository revealed a significant number of discoveries about preprints and how the publication process affects preprints overall.
Data availability and statistical measurements have a critical role in the publication process, which means authors should make sure these parts are obvious before submitting their preprints.
We found that overtime more and more preprints are being published with great success, which encourages future use of this modality as a means of scientific communication.
Our document representation allows the potential of future applications such as system that identifies preprints with weak or errenous claims or building a text mining system for network construction.
This work sets up a baseline for subsequent improvemnts on journal recommendation systems as more informaiton besides paper content is required for improved results.
Lastly, recommend that authors allows their preprints be posted and/or published with an open license to improve open science and communication.
