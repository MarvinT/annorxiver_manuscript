## Conclusion and Future Directions

Linguistic analysis of the bioRxiv repository revealed valuable information about preprints and how the peer review process affects preprints overall.
Data availability and statistical measurements have a critical role in the publication process, which means authors should make sure these parts are obvious before submitting their preprints.
Overtime more and more preprints are getting published with great success, which encourages future use of this paradigm as a means of scientific communication.
Our document representation serves as a basis for future applications such as a system that can validate preprints claims or building a text mining system for network construction.
Plus, this work sets up a baseline for subsequent improvements on systems that solve the journal recommendation problem as other information besides paper content is required for improved results.
Lastly, we recommend that authors allow their preprints be posted and/or published with an open license to improve open science and communication.
