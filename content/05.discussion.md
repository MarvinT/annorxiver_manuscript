## Discussion

We analyzed the language contained within preprints and observed how it changes through the publication process.  
We found that bioRxiv and Pubmed Central (PMC) have similar word frequency distributions (Figure {@fig:kl_divergence}), which suggests that quite a number of preprints are being published into journals participating in PMC's Open Access corpus [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133]. 
We also found that tokens highly associated with bioRxiv are related to the neuroscience and bioinformatics field when compared to PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
This observation arose as bioRxiv has an influx of neuroscience and bioinformatics preprints (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Furthermore, this influx is the reason for our second principal component depicting the concept of "neuroscience vs bioinformatics" (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot}).

We found that over time preprints are successfully getting published at a higher rate than previously estimated (Figure {@fig:updated_pub_rate}).
This observation supports the efficacy of preprints and counters previous findings that suggested preprints are slow to publish [@doi:10.1002/leap.1265].
We trained two nearest-neighbor classifiers to recommend journals based on the content of a preprint.
Our first classifier recommend journals based on top ten closest papers and our second classifier recommends journals based on an average of all papers published in a given journal.
Both classifers obtained modest results (Figure {@fig:knn_auc}), which suggests that journal recommendation requires more information than just paper content alone. 
Plus, this task is cofounded by megajournals as they publish a vast number of articles covering a multiple of different research categories ever year [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165359].
Overall, our findings confirm that preprints are advantageous to the scientific community.
