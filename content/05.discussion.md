## Discussion

We analyzed the language contained within preprints and observed how it changes through the publication process.  
We found that bioRxiv and Pubmed Central (PMC) have similar word frequency distributions (Figure {@fig:kl_divergence}), which highlights that preprints are published in a number of journals that are apart of the PMC repository [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133]. 
We also found that tokens highly associated with bioRxiv are related to the neuroscience and bioinformatics field when compared to PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Reason for this observation is due to bioRxiv's influx of neuroscience and bioinformatics preprints (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
This influx is the second strongest source of variation when analyzing the document embedding analysis of bioRxiv (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot}).

We found that over time preprints are successfully getting published at a higher rate than previously estimated (Figure {@fig:updated_pub_rate}).
This observation supports the efficacy of preprints and counters previous findings that suggest preprints are slow to publish [@doi:10.1002/leap.1265].
We trained two nearest-neighbor classifiers to recommend journals based on the content of a preprint.
These classifers obtained modest results (Figure {@fig:
