## Introduction

Preprints are scholarly works that have yet to undergo the peer review process.
This concept was constructed by physicsts back in the 1990s [@doi:10.15252/embj.201695531] and are now becoming an essential part of the scientific community [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1126/science.aaq0747; @doi:10.1126/science.aaf9133; @doi:10.1038/s41557-020-0477-5].
Typically, preprints are hosted by repositories such as arxiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however there are over 60 different preprint repositories [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
Preprints allow for scientists to communicate the results of their work without being delayed by the publcation process [@doi:10.1177/0192623318767322].
Furthermore, preprints received higher citation counts compared to articles just sent for publication [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @arxiv:1805.05238].

Despite the usefulness of preprints, there has been much skepticism on their validity.
Since preprints aren't peer reviewed, it allows for spurious claims to arise [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05789-4; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m3111].
Perfect example is the explosion of preprints on COVID-19 [@doi:10.1101/2020.09.04.20188771; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m3111].
Plus, there are some skepticism on the success of preprints surviving the publication process [@doi:10.1002/leap.1265].
Others encourage more scientists to adaopt this modality [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549; @doi:10.1038/530265a;@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151; @doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000259].
Nontheless, preprints have become a major part within the publication process.

Majority of work that involving preprints have focused on the audience [10.1371/journal.pone.0047523] and measuring publication success from preprints [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269], analyzing the audience that reads [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589] and analyzing the validity of 
Covid-19 preprints [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.22.111294].

Despite the discoveres above, a gap that remains unfulfilled is understanding the language contained in preprints and how it adapts as preprints undergo the peer review process.
In this paper, we seek to fill in this gap by conducting a lingusitic analysis on the bioRxiv repository.
We conducted a series of analyses to determine the differences between preprints and published literature on a local and global scale.
We also developed a tool that provides the life sciences' community with possible journal endpoints for their respective preprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv.
By undergoing this lingusitic analysis, we will obtain a better understanding on the textual content of preprints as well as the textual changes required for the publiction process.
