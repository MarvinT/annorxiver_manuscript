## Introduction

Preprints are scholarly works that are shared before they have been formally peer reviewed and published.
The practice of sharing manuscripts before peer review has a long history [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].
The longest use on an ongoing basis started with physicists in the 1990s [@doi:10.15252/embj.201695531] and have become an essential tool for the scientific community [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1126/science.aaf9133; @doi:10.1038/s41557-020-0477-5].
Preprints were used in the life sciences in the 1960s before publisher pressure stopped the practice [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].
Life sciences preprints have made a resurgence within the past decade [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001].
Common preprint repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different preprint repositories [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
Preprints are becoming widely accepted and used within the life sciences community [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151; @doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000259], providing an opportunity to examine their impact.

The scientific community has begun to analyze the impact of preprints in the life sciences.
Studies have found that preprints are being posted at a high rate [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269] and are rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited often [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Certain categories of preprints seem to be read and shared differently by both scientists and non-scientists [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
Across preprint servers, analyses suggest that between two thirds and three quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175].
Time required for a preprint to be published can vary from preprint to preprint; however, studies have found that preprints with a single version take less time than preprints with multiple versions [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].
Articles with preprints were more cited and more discussed than those without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646].

Existing work largely focuses on the metadata associated with life sciences preprints.
There is still a gap in understanding the language authors use in preprints and examining how language shifts between preprint and peer reviewed manuscript provides a unique opportunity to examine how the publishing process impacts the scholarly literature.
We sought to understand the language landscape of preprints by performing a linguistic analysis of the _bioRxiv_ corpus.
We also examine textual differences between preprints and published literature by comparing the entire corpus of preprints with that available in the open access PubMed Central repository as well as a restricted set of preprint-published pairs.
We find that neural-network derived document embeddings provide a useful space for determining the textual similarity of preprints.
Preprints' nearest neighbors in this space are likely to share an eventual publishing venue with the preprint, so we created a webserver that will display these neighbors for any preprint on _bioRxiv_ or _medRxiv_.
Proximity in this space also reveals preprint-publication pairs that earlier analyses have been unable to identify.
Our linguistic analysis reveals the impact of the publishing process, introduces a method to identify similar preprints, demonstrates that the text content of preprints is related to their eventual publication venue, and provides a more complete picture of the fraction of preprint that are eventually published.
