## Introduction

Preprints are scholarly works that are shared before they have been formally peer reviewed and published.
The practice of sharing preprints before peer review has a long history [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].
The longest ongoing use started with physicists in the 1990s [@doi:10.15252/embj.201695531] and have become an essential tool for the scientific community [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1126/science.aaf9133; @doi:10.1038/s41557-020-0477-5].
Preprints were used in the life sciences community during the 1960s before publisher pressure stopped the practice [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].
Over the past decade preprints have made a resurgence within the life sciences community [@doi:10.1101/833400; @doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001].
Common preprint repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different repositories available[@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
Generally, preprints are becoming widely accepted and used within the life sciences community [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151; @doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000259], which provides an opportunity to examine their impact.

The scientific community has begun to analyze the impact of preprints in the life sciences.
Studies have found that preprints are being posted at a high rate [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269]. 
Studies have also found that preprints are rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited often [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Articles with matching preprint versions were cited and discussed more often than articles without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646].
Certain categories of preprints seem to be read and shared differently by both scientists and non-scientists [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
Across preprint servers, analyses suggest that between two-thirds to three-quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175].
Time required for a preprint to be published can vary from preprint to preprint; however, studies have found that preprints with a single version often take less time than preprints with multiple versions [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].

Existing work largely focuses on the metadata associated with life sciences preprints.
There is still a gap in understanding the language authors use in preprints and how that language shifts during the peer review process.
Examining this shift will provide a unique opportunity to ascertain parts of the publishing process and how it impacts the scholarly literature.
We sought to understand the language landscape of preprints by performing a linguistic analysis of the _bioRxiv_ corpus.
We examined textual differences between preprints and published literature by comparing the entire corpus of preprints with articles available in the open access PubMed Central repository.
We also examined linguistic differences between preprints and their corresponding published pairs.
We found that neural-network derived document embeddings provide a useful space for determining the textual similarity of preprints.
In this space a preprint's nearest neighbors are likely to share an eventual publishing venue with the preprint itself.
We created a webserver that will display these neighbors for any preprint on _bioRxiv_ or _medRxiv_.
Close proximity within this space also revealed missing preprint-publication pairs that earlier analyses have been unable to identify.
Overall, our linguistic analysis reveals the impact of the publishing process, introduces a method to identify matching preprint-published article pairs, demonstrates that the text content of preprints is related to their eventual publication venue, and provides a more complete picture of the fraction of preprints that are eventually published.
