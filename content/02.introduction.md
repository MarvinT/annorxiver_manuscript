## Introduction

Preprints are becoming an essential part of the scientific publication life cycle [@doi:doi:10.1038/530265a;@doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035].
Preprint are scientific articles that have yet to undergo the peer review process. 
They serve as a means to improve visibility of one's own research as well as provide an opportunity to get helpful feedback prior to journal submission.

1. Talk about biorxiv and discuss how it is one of the repositories that maintains preprints along with citation of others such as arxiv/medrxiv etc.

Mention arxiv [@url:https://arxiv.org], prepubmed [@url:http://www.prepubmed.org], medrxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/], biorxiv etc.

2. Discuss works that analyze biorxiv from an audience perspective (quantifying tweets etc.)

Rxivist [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269]
Audiences preprint [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589]
Covid-19 preprint analysis [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.22.111294]

3. Mention the gap which consists of analysing the language of biorxiv preprints (first to do this)
4. ^ Why is this important? What will this allow for future research projects?

The above work hasn't studied the language of biorxiv which is the game we are trying to fix.
By studying the langauge of preprints one can do lots of future tasks that are important

5. Provide list of contributions within this manuscript
