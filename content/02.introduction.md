## Introduction

Preprints are scholarly works that have yet to undergo the peer review process.
They were first used by physicists back in the 1990s [@doi:10.15252/embj.201695531] and have become an essential tool for the scientific community [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1126/science.aaf9133; @doi:10.1038/s41557-020-0477-5].
Preprints are generally hosted within repositories such as arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different preprint repositories in total [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].

Preprints can be considered a double-edged sword for the scientific community.
The biggest benefit is that preprints allow for scientists to communicate the results of their work without being delayed by the publication process [@doi:10.1177/0192623318767322].
Plus, it has been shown that article with a corresponding preprint  received higher citation counts and publicity compared to their counterparts. [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @arxiv:1805.05238; @doi:10.1101/673665].
On the other hand, preprints aren't subjected peer review which allows for spurious or incorrect claims to arise [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05789-4; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m3111].
Perfect example would be on the explosion of preprints for the COVID-19 pandemic as a great deal of untrustworthy preprints were posted in bioRxiv and medRxiv [@doi:10.1101/2020.09.04.20188771; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m3111].
Additionally, there has been skepticism on the success of preprints outlasting the publication process [@doi:10.1002/leap.1265].
Despite the pros and cons of preprints, majority of the scientific community view them in a positive light and have encouraged more and more scientists to adopt this form of communication [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151; @doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000259].

The bulk of analyses that involve preprints focus on areas of preprint popularity, the preprint audience, publication success of preprints and validating preprint claims.
Regarding preprint popularity, authors found that preprints have a short time delay before becoming quite popular on communicative platforms such as twitter and google scholar [10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Similar studies have found that preprints are being posted at a high rate [@doi:10.1007/s11192-020-03430-8; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269].
Meanwhile authors studying the audience that reads preprints found a political link between the non-scientific community and preprint categories [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
In relation to publication success, there are studies that suggest preprints are being published at a high rate [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001], while others suggest an inverse trend [@doi:10.1002/leap.1265; @doi:10.1101/2020.01.28.920546].
Lastly, there have been a number of studies that question the validity of preprint claims in respect to the COVID-19 pandemic [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.22.111294; @doi:10.1101/2020.09.04.20188771; @doi:10.1038/d41586-020-01394-6].

Despite the discoveries above, there is still a gap in understanding the language contained in preprints and how it changes as preprints undergo the peer review process.
In this paper, we seek to remedy this gap by conducting a linguistic analysis on the bioRxiv repository.
We conducted a series of analyses to determine the differences between preprints and published literature on a local and global scale.
We also developed a tool that provides the life sciences' community with possible journal endpoints for their respective preprints posted in the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories.
Through this linguistic analysis we will gain better insight on the language contained in bioRxiv preprints as well as gain more insight on the textual requirements for the peer review process.
