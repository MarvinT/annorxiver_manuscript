## Abstract {.page_break_before}

**Motivation**: Preprints allow researchers to make their results quickly and widely accessible to the scientific community. 
These are scholarly works that have yet to undergo the peer review process and are often hosted within open access repositories such as bioRxiv. 
The majority of studies involving bioRxiv have focused on tracking preprint popularity, analyzing the crowds that read preprints and measuring the preprint-publication lifecycle; however, a fundamental piece that is missing is an understanding of the language contained within preprints and how that language changes through the publishing process.   
**Objective**: We sought to examine the linguistic features of bioRxiv preprints and compare them to their published counterparts.  
**Methods**: We compared the bioRxiv preprint corpus against Pubmed Central’s Open Access corpus (PMC) and New York Times Annotate Corpus (NYTAC) using standard linguistic methods.
Next, we trained a word2vec model to generate word embeddings for every word within the bioRxiv corpus and used these embeddings to generate document representations for every article within bioRxiv and PMC. 
We used these embeddings for applications that aide bioRxiv in conjunction with the scientific community.
**Results**: We found that topic-specific terms such as “genome”, “neuron” and “network” were enriched within bioRxiv compared to PMC, reflecting bioRxiv’s uptake in bioinformatics and neuroscience preprints. 
We found that the leading source of linguistic variation among preprints captured the distinction between quantitative and cellular biology. 
We used our document embedding space to identify ~1700 published preprints that had not been linked to their respective journal versions.
We also used our embedding space to idenfity journals that publish lingusitically similar papers to preprints.
We quantified the time delay preprints face while undergoing the peer review process.
We made this space available via a web app that allows anyone to input a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint doi and receive a set of the most linguistically similar journals and articles to serve as potential publication venues for their work.
