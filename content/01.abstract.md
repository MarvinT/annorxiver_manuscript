## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Preprints allow researchers to make their results quickly and widely accessible to the scientific community. 
These are scholarly works that have yet to undergo the peer review process and are often hosted within open access repositories such as bioRxiv. 
The majority of studies involving bioRxiv have focused on preprint metadata; however, a fundamental piece that is missing is an understanding of the language contained within preprints and how it changes through the peer review process.   
We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to their published counterparts within Pubmed Central’s Open Access corpus (PMC).  
We quantified the time delay preprints face while undergoing the peer review process.
We generated document embeddings for every article within bioRxiv and PMC.
We used these embeddings to idenitfy missing preprint-publication links along with training machine learning models to predict journal endpoints for published articles.
We found that topic-specific terms such as “genome”, “neuron” and “network” were enriched within bioRxiv compared to PMC, reflecting bioRxiv’s uptake in bioinformatics and neuroscience preprints. 
We found that the leading source of linguistic variation among preprints captured the distinction between quantitative and cellular biology.
We discovered that preprints are delayed an average of 16 days as changes are requested from the peer review process.
Lastly, we created a web app allows anyone to input a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint and receive a set of the most linguistically similar journals and articles to serve as potential publication venues for their work.
