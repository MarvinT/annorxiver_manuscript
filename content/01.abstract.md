## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Preprints allow researchers to make their findings available to the scientific community before they have undergone peer review.
This provides an opportunity to understand life sciences peer review and publishing practices.
Studies of bioRxiv to date have been largely focused on article metadata, and have examined how preprints are downloaded, cited, published, and discussed online.
A missing element has been examining the language contained within preprints.
Comparing preprints with peer reviewed manuscripts provides an opportunity to examine how peer review changes these documents.   
We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to biomedical text as a whole and also their published counterparts.
The most prevalent elements that changed appeared to be associated with typesetting and mentions of supplementary or additional files.
We created document embeddings derived from a bioRxiv-trained word2vec model and found that they revealed different scientific approaches, linked unannotated preprint-peer reviewed article pairs, and were associated with the journal where a preprint would eventually be published.
We examined factors associated with the time elapsed between the posting of a first preprint and the appearance of a peer reviewed publication and found that preprints with more versions posted and also those with more textual changes, assessed via document embeddings, took longer to publish.
The full text landscape of bioRxiv provides an opportunity to explore scientific language and how peer review alters articles.
We provide a web application with which users can explore how a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint is positioned within the landscape and identify the journals and articles that are most similar.
