### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### bioRxiv Repository

![
Neuroscience and bioinformatics are the two most common topics for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each author-selected topic area.

![
Most of bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.
This bar chart depicts the number of articles categorized based on author-selected article types.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/annorxiver/94874e0f1e35bd667bf3b7c3dc6416068779444f/biorxiv/exploratory_data_analysis/output/figures/preprint_headings.png){#fig:biorxiv_headings}

Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

#### Global Comparison of bioRxiv and PubMed Central 

![
BioRxiv is more focused on biological discoveries rather than disease treatments and clinical trials.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared preprints in bioRxiv with published manuscripts in PMC.
We found that tokens such as "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" had a high odds ratio, indicating enrichment in bioRxiv (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Likewise, we found tokens such as "patient", "health", $\pm$, and "ml" to have a low odds ratio, indicating enrichment in PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
This separation of tokens suggests a prevalence of articles focused on clinical trials and patient research within PMC compared to bioRxiv.
Furthermore, bioRxiv has a predominance of neuroscience and bioinformatic topics.
In regard to writing, citation styles diversify from the familiar "et al." form as preprints transition through the publication process.
Additionally, published articles have an increase of typesetting ($\pm$) and measurement symbols ("ml", "age") compared to preprints. 

#### Published Preprint Differences

![
Top scoring tokens for preprints are focused on figure citations whereas their published versions are more focused on data availability.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to preprints.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with preprints while values less than one indicate a high association with published articles.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in preprints and published versions of preprints respectively.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danich1/annorxiver/f5d6c2d04e2fef0d38eaee77ef6c2a0b19ef6358/biorxiv/corpora_comparison/output/figures/preprint_published_comparison.png){#fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}

A preprint's linguistic style can change once a preprint has undergone the revision process prior to being published.
We quantified this linguistic difference by calculating the odds ratio of tokens appearing in the union in bioRxiv preprints and their published counterparts within PMC.
Tokens with an odds ratio greater than one are mainly centered on paper/figure references and research specific terms (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).
Tokens with an odds ratio of less than one are focused on data availability, and research measurements such as number of cases and controls or significance testing (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).

### Topic Analysis of bioRxiv's Principal Components

![
The top two principal components (PCs) appear to capture the concepts of molecular biology vs quantitative biology (PC1) and neuroscience vs bioinformatics (PC2).
The word clouds (A, C) depict the cosine similarity score between tokens and the first two PCs.
Tokens in orange are most similar to a PC's positive direction while tokens in blue are most similar to a PC's negative direction.
The size of each token indicates the magnitude of the similarity score.
The scatter plot at the top right (B) is a visualization of documents being plotted along the PC directions.
Article categories were hand-picked based on the concepts captured by each PC.

Table: Top five and bottom five systems biology preprints projected onto the PC1 direction. These preprints contain quantitative and molecular biology concepts respectively. {#tbl:five_pc1_table}

We explored the primary differences between the full text of bioRxiv preprints by performing principal components analysis on generated document embeddings.
We visualized the correspondence between tokens and the loadings for each principal component (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)A,C).
We also visualized documents projected on selected principal components (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)B).
The first principal component separates bioRxiv preprints that encompass molecular biology results with preprints that contain quantitative biology results (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)C).
This highlights the bisection of biomedical research where majority of results can be categorized under the molecular biology category or the quantitative biology category.
Furthermore, this bisecting trend is evident across individual preprint categories as most categories lie on either side of the first principal component (Figure {@fig:pca1_pointplot}).
We also provide example preprints from the systems biology category to reinforce this concept (Table {@tbl:five_pc1_table}).
 
The second principal component represents the concept of neuroscience vs bioinformatics (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot)A).
This principal component suggests that the bulk of preprints within bioRxiv are largely focused around neuroscience and bioinformatic concepts.
This split is evident in Figure {@fig:pca2_pointplot} as enriched categories along this principal component are quite related to neuroscience (negative end) or bioinformatics (positive end).
As with the first principal component we provide example preprints from the systems biology category to reinforce this concept (Supplemental Table {@tbl:five_pc2_table}).
