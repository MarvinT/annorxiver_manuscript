## Results

### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of bioRxiv's Principal Components

![
The top two principal components (PCs) consit of the following concepts: molecular vs quantitative biology and genomics vs neuroscience.
The left most plot (A) is a word cloud for the second PC.
Tokens in orange are associated with a PC's positive axis while tokens in blue are associated with the PC's negative axis.
The word cloud at the bottom right (C) represents the first PC and follows the same trend as previously described.
The scatter plot at the top right (B) is a visualization of documents being plotted along the PCs axes.
Documents were hand-picked based on the concepts captured by each PC.

The leading source of variation within biorxiv preprints is molecular biology vs quantitative biology (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot) C).
This highlights the dichotomous structure of biological research as many preprints contain numerical results or pictorial results.
The second leading source of variation contains the concept of neuroscience and genomics (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot) A).
This is expected as biorxiv has a large presence of neuroscience and bioinformatic preprints.


### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
