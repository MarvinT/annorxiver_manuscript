## Results

### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of bioRxiv's Principal Components

![
The top two PCs are molecular vs quantitative biology and genomics vs neuroscience.
The left most plot (A) is a word cloud for the second principal component (pc).
Tokens in blue are associated with the pc's positive axis while tokens in orange are associated with the pc's negative axis.
Similar to above the word cloud at the bottom right (C) represents the first principal component.
The scatter plot on the top right (B) is a visualization of documents being plotted along the components.
Categories for this plot have been hand-picked based on topics captured by each pc.

2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
