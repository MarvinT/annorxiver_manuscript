## Results

### Comparing bioRxiv to PubMed Central

#### Global View
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between bioRxiv and PubMed Central (based on odds ratio)

#### Published Preprint Differences
1. Create a treemap visualization of top X terms that are different between Preprint and Published documents (based on odds ratio)

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of bioRxiv's Principal Components

![
The top two principal components (PCs) consist of the following concepts: molecular vs quantitative biology (PC1) and genomics vs bioinformatics (PC2).
The left most plot (A) is a word cloud for the second PC.
Tokens in orange are associated with a PC's positive axis while tokens in blue are associated with the PC's negative axis.
The size of each token indicates the strength of association.
The word cloud at the bottom right (C) is for the first PC and follows the same trend as previously described.
The scatter plot at the top right (B) is a visualization of documents being plotted along the PC's axes.
Documents were hand-picked based on the concepts captured by each PC.

The most predominant source of variation within bioRxiv preprints is the concept of molecular biology vs quantitative biology (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot) C).
This highlights the bisection of biomedical research where majority of results came from molecular biology experiments or quantitative biology experiments.
The second most predominant source of variation is the concept of neuroscience vs bioinformatics (Figure {@fig:pca_word_cloud_plot) A).
This suggests that the bulk of preprints are centered around neuroscience and bioinformatic research fields.
More word clouds can be found within our online repository (see Data Availability).

### Journal Recommendations/Audience Associations
1. Title will change once analysis is finished 
2. Provide key figure for this section and take-home message
