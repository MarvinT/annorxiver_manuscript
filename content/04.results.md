#### bioRxiv Repository

![
Neuroscience and bioinformatics are the two most common topics for preprints on bioRxiv.
This bar chart depicts the number of preprints that fall into each author-selected topic area.

Most of bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.
This bar chart depicts the number of articles categorized based on author-selected article types.

Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

#### Global Comparison of bioRxiv and PubMed Central 

![
BioRxiv is more focused on biological discoveries rather than disease treatments and clinical trials.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared preprints in bioRxiv with published manuscripts in PMC.
We found that tokens such as "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" had a high odds ratio, indicating enrichment in bioRxiv (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
Likewise, we found tokens such as "patient", "health", $\plusminus$, and "ml" to have a low odds ratio, indicating enrichment in PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
This separation of tokens suggests a prevalence of articles focused on clinical trials and patient research within PMC compared to bioRxiv.
Furthermore, bioRxiv has a predominance of neuroscience and bioinformatic topics.
In regard to writing, citation styles diversify from the familiar "et al." form as preprints transition through the publication process.
Additionally, published articles have an increase of typesetting ($\plusminus$) and measurement symbols ("ml", "age") compared to preprints. 

#### Published Preprint Differences

![
Top scoring tokens for preprints are focused on figure citations whereas their published versions are more focused on data availability.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to preprints.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with preprints while values less than one indicate a high association with published articles.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in preprints and published versions of preprints respectively.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/annorxiver/e32661b855cc6622cc1138fcd1606ef3500f0ff9/biorxiv/corpora_comparison/output/figures/preprint_published_comparison.png){#fig:biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}

A preprint's linguistic style can change once a preprint has undergone the revision process prior to being published.
We quantified this linguistic difference by calculating the odds ratio of tokens appearing in the union in bioRxiv preprints and their published counterparts within PMC.
Tokens with an odds ratio greater than one are mainly centered on paper/figure references and research specific terms (Figure {@fig: biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).
Tokens with an odds ratio of less than one are focused on data availability, and research measurements such as number of cases and controls or significance testing (Figure {@fig: biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).

### The bioRxiv Preprint Landscape
1. Provide the tSNE figure of the bioRxiv 
2. Discuss the results of the tSNE figure and highlight that there are category clusters within the figure

### Topic Analysis of Principal Components
1. Provide an example of the word cloud for principal components
2. Show plot of the principal components and the scatterplot
3. Mention that the word clouds can be found at xyz

### Mending Missing Preprints to Published Versions Linkss

![
The distances between preprints and their published version is on average lower than the distance between preprints and a randomly selected article.
This violin plot shows the distribution of distances between both categories.

Accuracy decreases as preprint distances become larger and larger. 
This bar chart depicts the fraction of true positives over the total number of pairs in each bin.
Each bin contains a total of 200 annotated pairs and is based on the percentiles of the preprint-published distribution.

Using Euclidean distance between article embeddings is a promising approach to finding missing links between preprints and published versions.
There is a notable distance between the true distribution (preprint vs published) and the null distribution (preprint vs random) (Figure {@fig:article_distance_distributions}), which suggests that article pairs with low enough distances may indicate a potential link.
We annotated 200 potential links with a high inter-rater reliability score (Cohen's Kappa [@doi:10.1177/001316446002000104]) of 91.7%, which suggests high agreement between annotators.
Furthermore, article pairs whose distance falls below the 50th percentile have a high chance of being a true positive (Figure {@fig:article_bin_accuracy}).
