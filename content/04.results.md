Most of bioRxiv's preprints report new research findings.

Each preprint on bioRxiv has an author-selected topic area, and the predominant area in past reports has been neuroscience [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133].
Our analysis of the full text release of bioRxiv confirms this previous finding (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
The author-selected topic area abundances that we found in the full text largely matched previous studies [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133; @doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].
One exception was microbiology, which has a larger share of preprints than in a previous report from 2018 [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_categories}).
Authors also select from three article types when they upload their preprints.
We found that most preprints are categorized as new results (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_headings}), which is consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1001/jama.2017.21168].

BioRxiv is more similar to PubMed Central than to the reference corpus.
This barplot represents the KL divergence between bioRxiv, Pubmed Central and the reference corpus.
The y-axis is the KL divergence metric where lower values indicates similar distributions and vice versa for higher values.
The x-axis represents the number of highly occuring tokens used to calculate the KL divergence.

BioRxiv is more focused on biological discoveries rather than disease treatments and clinical trials.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to bioRxiv.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with bioRxiv whereas values less than one indicate high association with PubMed Central.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a bar chart of token frequency appearing in bioRxiv and PMC respectively.

The linguistic style of the bioRxiv corpus differs from the PMC corpus.
We compared and contrasted preprints in bioRxiv, published manuscripts in PMC and newspaper articles from the New York Times (NYTAC) against eachother.
We refer to NYTAC as our reference corpus for the following analysis.
We found that bioRxiv is more similar to PMC than to the reference in terms of token frequencies and corpora statistics (Figure {@fig:kl_divergence} and Table {@tbl:corpora_stats}).
When comparing bioRxiv and PMC to the reference, topic associated and measurement related tokens appear highly enriched (Supplemental Figures {@fig:biorxiv_v_reference} and {@fig:pmc_v_reference}).
Furthermore, we found that tokens such as "neuron", "genome", "RNA" and "network" had a high odds ratio, while tokens such as "patient", "health", $\pm$, and "ml" to have a low odds ratio when comparing bioRxiv to PMC (Figure {@fig:biorxiv_pmc_global_comparison}).
This separation of tokens suggests that articles focused on clinical trials and patient research are more prevalent in PMC than to bioRxiv.
This separation also suggests that bioRxiv has a predominance of neuroscience and bioinformatic topics.
In regard to writing, citation styles diversify from the familiar "et al." form as preprints transition through the publication process.
Additionally, published articles have an increase of typesetting ($\pm$) and measurement symbols ("ml", "age") compared to preprints. 

#### Published Preprint Differences

![
Top scoring tokens for preprints are focused on figure citations whereas their published versions are more focused on data availability.
The plot on the left (A) is a point range plot of the odds ratio with respect to preprints.
Values greater than one indicate a high association with preprints while values less than one indicate a high association with published articles.
The dotted line provides a breaking point between both categories.
The plot on the right (B) is a barchart of token frequency appearing in preprints and published versions of preprints respectively.

A preprint's linguistic style can change once a preprint has undergone the revision process prior to being published.
We quantified this linguistic difference by calculating the odds ratio of tokens appearing in the union in bioRxiv preprints and their published counterparts within PMC.
Tokens with an odds ratio greater than one are mainly centered on paper/figure references and research specific terms (Figure {@fig: biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).
Tokens with an odds ratio of less than one are focused on data availability, and research measurements such as number of cases and controls or significance testing (Figure {@fig: biorxiv_pmc_pre_published_comp}).
